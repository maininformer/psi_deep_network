# Predicting Percent Spliced In in Alternative Splicing Using Deep Networks

In this project we tried exploring non-linearities in genomics data using deep networks. The jupyter notebook has all  the code that was used to produce the report except the tunning. The tunning was done in another scripts and the models were pickled. The code is a bit long so I encourage skimming the report first for some background. [Keras](https://keras.io/) was used for creating the deep networks.
